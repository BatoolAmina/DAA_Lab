Ques: Write a short note on backtracking?

Backtracking is an algorithmic technique used for solving problems incrementally by trying possible solutions and backtracking when a solution path is not feasible. It is often used for problems that involve searching through a large set of possibilities, such as combinatorial problems.

Key Concepts:

Incremental Search:
The algorithm builds the solution step by step, considering one possibility at a time.

Exploration of Possibilities:
If a partial solution seems promising, it proceeds to the next step.
If a partial solution violates problem constraints or leads to an unworkable state, the algorithm backtracks and tries the next available option.

Depth-First Search (DFS):
Backtracking is often implemented using DFS, where the algorithm explores one branch of the solution space before moving to the next.

Pruning:
Backtracking prunes the search space by abandoning paths that do not lead to a solution, thus reducing unnecessary computation.

Steps of Backtracking:
Choose: Select the first choice from the available options.
Explore: Move to the next step based on the current choice.
Check: If the current solution is valid, continue exploring.
Backtrack: If the solution is invalid or cannot lead to an optimal solution, undo the current choice and try the next one.

Advantages:
Optimal: Can find an optimal solution when applicable.
General Approach: Useful for many combinatorial problems where exhaustive search is required.

Disadvantages:
Inefficiency: Can be slow, as it may explore all possible solutions, especially for large search spaces.
Memory Intensive: Storing partial solutions can require significant memory.
