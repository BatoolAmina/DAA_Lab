A Binomial Heap is a collection of binomial trees that satisfies the min-heap property (the key of a parent node is less than or equal to the keys of its children). It is used in applications requiring efficient merging of heaps.
What is a Binomial Tree? 
A Binomial Tree of order 0 has 1 node. A Binomial Tree of order k can be constructed by taking two binomial trees of order k-1 and making one the leftmost child of the other. 
A Binomial Tree of order k the has following properties:
It has exactly 2k nodes. 
It has depth as k. 
There are exactly kaiCi nodes at depth i for i = 0, 1, . . . , k. 
The root has degree k and children of the root are themselves Binomial Trees with order k-1, k-2,.. 0 from left to right. 

Operations on Binomial Heap
The operations that can be performed on binomial heap are listed as follows -
Creating a binomial heap
Finding the minimum key
Union or merging of two binomial heaps
Inserting a node
Extracting minimum key
Decreasing a key
Deleting a node

Applications:
Priority Queues: Tasks requiring fast merging of priority queues, such as job scheduling and event simulation.
Graph Algorithms: Used in algorithms like Prim's MST and Dijkstra's shortest path.

Advantages:
Efficient merge operation (O(logn)), making it suitable for dynamic scenarios with frequent heap combinations.

Disadvantages:
More complex structure and operations compared to simpler heaps like binary heaps.
